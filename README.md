# Ferox
![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/olliem5/ferox/total)

- An old private client, now made public, due to me not developing for anarchy anymore.

### Info
- The default ClickGUI bind is `p`.
- The default chat prefix is `%`.
- [Baritone API](https://github.com/cabaletta/baritone/releases/download/v1.2.15/baritone-api-forge-1.2.15.jar) is required to run the client.

### Known Bugs
- Chams crashes when enabling it for the first time, after game restart works as normal.
